## Known issues

There are some texture types even if they are  marked as readable and their format is Sprite & 2D, They are not imported properly and may cause an error related to image encoding and compression. There are two sample images inside the package which work perfectly with this tool. “Google Logo” and “Japan Game Logo”. For testing purposes you can use them or create texture with the same property as theirs.


### Note
The image “Google Logo” is trademark of Google. Here it is only used for educational/non commercial purposes. And is not meant for distribution.
